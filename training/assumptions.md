# Assumptions
For the sake of this training programe we are making a number of assumptions about what the student knows prior to beginning the course. These assumptions are documented here and we will update this list as we discover more. It is my intention that this list will be hyperlinked to existing trainign material or documentation for each of these topics. In that way this document can evolve into a starting point for the student to be able to reference and do some independant study prior to embarking on this journey.

As to the specific day this training  is being developed for, this list should in some fashon be included in the prerequisite material. The intention is that the students will review the material they feel they are weak in prior to attending the class.


Assumptions:
 - Working knowledge of:
  - Linux
  - Systems administration
  - Networking principles (likely a week spot for some attendees)
  - Database administration basics (likly a missing skill for some attendees)
  - Open source (floss) (Might be a good idea to talk about this a bit)
  - Agile development model theories (We might need to level up here)
  - git and GitHub (might need to level up here)
  - Puppet
 - Working knowledge of AWS
  - EC2
   - Instance sizing and pricing considerations
  - Load Balancers
  - RDS
  - S3
  - Security groups
  - IAM
  - Security Rolls (including assume roll)
  - Payer accounts
  - Virtual Networking
   - VPCs
   - Routing
   - Subnets (Public vs. Private)
   - Internet Gateways
   - Elastic IPs
   - VPN Connections
  - EFS
  - Route 53
 - No working knowledge of the AWS CLI (Amazon training does not cover this)
 - Local working environment not set up (Can we solve for this in some way?)
 - Twelve Factor
