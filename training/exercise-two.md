# Exercise Two
For this exercise we will take one or two of the topics we discovered in exercise one and see how we can apply the new operating principles to an actual deployment using Nubis.

This is a group discussion which will be led by the trainer. It should be interactive, asking lots of questions while engaging the students. The goal is to help them to start to envision how Nubis could be used to solve problems.

 - [Chose a Topic](#chose-a-topic)
 - [Diagram the deployment](#diagram-the-deployment)

## Chose a Topic
From the topics the groups discussed in exercise one, select one that will be easy to discuss and deploy using Nubis. If the topics are to general, select an application to discuss which is directly related to one of the topics.

## Diagram the deployment
On a whiteboard or large sticky note, diagram a deployment of the application using Nubis. Discuss how to move from existing code to a full deployment. Emphasis should be placed more on the problems being solved and less on the process of deployment.
